## Author

## License
This code forms part of an assessment and may not be used by any other party.

## System Requirements
This program requires at least Python 2.7 to be installed, as well as access to stdin and stdout.

## Run
Start the Program with Python like `python scoreboard.py`

## Assumptions Made
* Any number of players from 1 up to 6 may register to play.
* The program is to recognise spares/strikes and adapt for any additional balls in the last frame, as opposed to having the user literally enter the score for 10 frames.
* A GUI is not required.
* The scoreboard shall be printed to stdout.
* Demonstration of a particular programming style (MVC, OO, ...) is not required.
* Demonstration of the testing undertaken is not required/no particular development method (waterfall..) or testing method (unit tests..) is required.
